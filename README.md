# üèãÔ∏è About The Project

This project is a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) approach to modern smart gyms. Instead of using a traditional weight stack, this machine uses a powerful closed-loop servo motor (StepperOnline A6) controlled by an ESP32 to provide resistance. This allows for digitally adjustable weight, smooth operation, and the potential for advanced features like eccentric-only training, custom resistance curves, and workout tracking.

The core of the build relies on accessible components: the powerful ESP32, a reliable industrial servo, a standard gym cable/handle, and custom 3D-printed parts for the spool and mounting.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- Digitally Adjustable Resistance: Change your "weight" from a web interface or physical buttons.
- High-Torque Servo: The StepperOnline A6 servo provides strong, smooth, and precise resistance.
- ESP32 Controller: Wi-Fi and Bluetooth-ready for a new UI, mobile app control, and OTA (Over-The-Air) updates.
- Fully Open-Source: All 3D models (STL/STEP) and firmware code are provided.
- Cost-Effective: Built for a fraction of the cost of commercial smart gyms.
- Customizable: Modify the code to add new modes (eccentric, isometric, chains) or integrate with other fitness apps.

## üîå Wiring Diagram

Here is the basic wiring schematic for connecting the ESP32 to the servo driver.

Warning: You are working with high-voltage AC (for the PSU) and high-current DC (for the servo). Always double-check your connections and ensure everything is unplugged when wiring.

(A simplified diagram. The A6 driver manual will have detailed pinouts for alarm, enable, and pulse/dir signals.)

| from ESP32 | to A6 servo |
|--|--|
| GPIO 34 (Potentiometer in)  | None | 
| GPIO 25 (DAC out) | Pin 20 |
| GPIO 4 (Servo ON signal) | Pin 33 |
| Gnd | Pin 19 & Pin 29 |


## üíæ Firmware Setup

The firmware is written using the Arduino framework for the ESP32.

1. IDE: Open this project in PlatformIO (recommended) or the Arduino IDE.
2. Libraries: Install the required libraries (e.g., ESPAsyncWebServer, AccelStepper).
3. Flash: Build and upload the firmware to your ESP32.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Power On: Connect the power supply and turn on the system.
2. Connect: The ESP32 will create a Wi-Fi network (or join yours, based on your config). Connect to its IP address from your phone or computer.
3. Web Interface: You will see a simple web page.
4. Set Weight: Enter your desired resistance (in kg or lbs) and press "Set".
5. Work Out! The servo will engage and provide resistance as you pull the handle.

## üìà To-Do / Future Plans

[ ] Add eccentric resistance mode (higher resistance on release).

[ ] Implement a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) service for a mobile app.

[ ] Add a load cell to measure force accurately and provide real-time feedback.

[ ] Workout tracking and history.

[ ] Add physical buttons/encoder to set weight without a phone.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è

Build and use this device at your own risk.

This is an advanced DIY project that involves:

- High-Voltage AC: You will be working with mains AC voltage for the power supply, which carries a risk of severe electric shock or death.
- Powerful Motor: The A6 servo motor is extremely powerful. It can cause serious injury if hands, hair, or clothing get caught in the spool or cable.
- High Tension: The machine operates under high tension. Failure of 3D-printed parts, the cable, or mountings can result in a sudden release of load, posing a significant risk of injury.

The author(s) and contributors to this project assume no responsibility or liability for any injuries, damages, or losses resulting from the construction or use of this device. You are solely responsible for ensuring the safety of your build, performing all necessary safety checks, and using the machine in a safe manner.
